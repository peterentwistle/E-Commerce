 E-Commerce
==========

A flexible open source E-Commerce system for PHP. By Peter Entwistle and adapted by Reece Mackie (Rover656) to enable custom login systems.
This fork is intended for software distribution stores, but will eventually be updated to work with physical products.

HELP NEEDED:
I may need some help come to making the PayPal integration and improving the Encryption before release
